# Wireless things sensors after 1 year

Wireless things sensors are temperature sensors with a very long batter life. They. Here is an updated graph of all temperature sensor readings over time.

The external sensors voltages decreased, but appear to have levelled off. This is probably temperature related.

Conclusion: Wireless things temperature sensors are/were great value and the battery life is greater than 1 year from a CR2032.
