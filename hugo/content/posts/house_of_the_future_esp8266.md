# Update to the Central Heating System 

This describes an update which uses ESP8266 as remote sensors and removing Google calendar.

# Main processes interaction in the PiThermostat code.

We have recently updated the Raspberry Pi based Thermostat as discussed in previous posts and shown in a YouTube video. The idea is to move away from using multiple Raspberry Pis as networked temperature sensors, but use one central Raspberry Pi and serveral  ESP8266s instead. This can bring the price down to £6 if buying generic ESP8266s. The ESP8266 connects via WiFi to Django running on a central Raspberry Pi performing an HTTP request with the temperature and it's MAC address. The MAC is translated into a named temperature sensor reflecting the room location (e.g Attic/Living Room/Cellar) and given a weighting based on how important the room is deemed to be (cellar would be 1, a living room would be 5).

Django interface for adding ESP8266s. Multiplier is the weighting for the weighted mean calculation, Location is inside or outside and changes only the appropriate weighted mean and the ExpiryTime is how long a temperature reading will last in the weighted mean calculation without an update. If the battery were to go flat on Goliath, then 1 hour after the last reading Goliath would be dropped from both the weighted mean calculation and the front end display.

The code is available from https://github.com/tommybobbins/PiThermostat.The Raspberry Pi itself has been moved to a generic 433MHz transmitter as Noisepower are no longer producing boards. Code for the 433MHz transmitter is available from Github. Google Calendar is no longer used as the calendaring mechanism - Django happenings is used instead.

django-happenings based calendar. Each time period during a 24 hour window is assigned a Temperature. If there is no user override, then the Required Temperature will be taken from this calendar.

Interface running on a Wall Mounted Android device. Note that the screen auto-refreshes every 60 seconds for this particular interface.
The layout has been considerably revised, to make it simpler and more logical (buttons are always Red or Yellow), internal information is blue, external information (garden temperatures are green). It has been verified as working on both Android phones and tablets, iPads and on the Raspberry Pi official display.

ESP8266 running from LiPo battery (18650). Note the ESP is in Deep sleep as the LED is dimly lit. This photograph shows the Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 development board, but there is no reason that NodeMCU boards could not be used (£5). In addition, we are investigating moving to cheaper temperature sensors (DS18B20) which are available for 50 pence each

The associated image shows the ESP8266 running from an LiPo battery: The code is programmed for the ESP8266 to sleep for 15 minutes (indicated by the GPIO0 LED being very dimly lit as seen in the attached photograph), wake up, request and IP address and send an HTTP request to a hardcoded Web server http://192.168.1.130/checkin//temperature//

The code can be found in Github - https://github.com/tommybobbins/ESP8266-TMP102. The battery life is estimated to be 6 months, but we have seen at least 18 months lifetime from a single cell even when mounted outdoors.

 By bringing the price to monitor a room down to a reasonable value, multiple rooms will be able to be monitored cheaply. The front and back end code has been updated to allow sensors to appear and disappear randomly. For example the Internal/External weighted mean values are generated based on the total number of sensors found in that particular iteration.

During the simple setup, each sensor has to be assigned a weighting and this is easily performed via Django. As a sensor reports into Django/Redis, the weighted mean is adjusted (via process_temperatures.py) and the interface displays the calculated value. Should a sensor not exist, then redis will expire that sensor value after one hour (configurable in the Django setup as shown) and the now historic values will not be used for the weighted mean. This means that an individual sensor is entirely expendable. Once the battery is flat and then gets recharged it then performs it's first HTTP request and will automatically get re-added into the weighted mean.
