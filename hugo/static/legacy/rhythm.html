Seany, is definitely the key to this band, he is the main song writer 
and, without him, the band wouldn't be half as good. He could be 
classed as a cross between Lou Reed and Noel Gallagher, he's got the 
raw hard edged music and lyrical style of Lou Reed and the arrogance 
and passion for making it BIG like Noel.
 <P>
The rest of the band seem look up  to him as their  mentor,
calling him 'God' in a bit of a piss - take way, but deep down 
you know they mean it.
 <P>
The way he struts his stuff on stage is totally unique, there is pure 
energy from the moment he steps on stage until the moment the band 
leave.The way he throws his guitar about makes you wonder how he 
can play really complex riffs at the same time. He manages though, 
and it sounds class, could this be the next Jimi ????
 <P>
Well you will have to buy the records and find out.
