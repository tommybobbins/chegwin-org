	It doesn't happen often but when you go to a gig and an almost 
unheard of Band make the hair on the back of your neck stand on
 end you know that they are destined for bigger and better things.
 <P>
	You know that within the next 18 months they will be the 
next big thing, there faces will adorn the walls of thousands of
girls bedrooms and there singles will be broadcast all over the world.
 <P>
	Well Leaving Amanda are no exception. They formed in a seedy
backstreet of the roughest part of <A HREF="http://www.state51.co.uk/knowhere/529.html">Newcastle Upon Tyne</A>, not knowing their
real potential, early in September 1992. At the time they were only a
three peice with beaten up guitars and a vision. Originally "Mayney" 
the drummer wasn't part of the awsome collaboration and the group played 
acoustically for many months. 
 <P>
	As soon as you meet the band you can tell straight away who 
the driving force behind the the band is, songwriter, lead guitarist and
founder "Seany" tells how it all started when i met them after a gig at
Newcastles Riverside.
 <P>
	Seany - " Well it wasn't a concious decission, like. We just
moved in together moving up here from Manchester and just jammed for 
hours on end. I could tell we were gonna be big when we just clicked.
After the first jam we had a bang on version of the Six million Dollar
man, it was like our destiny. I just channeled the lads and once we were
all on the right track, we just kept going, getting better all the time."
 <P>
	The rest of the band members have the same philosophy as Seany,
live fast and die young. Tommy the bassist, a tall blonde rock 'n' roll
star, (his words not mine), sits in the corner after an exausting sixty
minute performance and lights up.
 <P>
	Tommy - " Ye, we all just slipped into it, it wasn't a concious
decission, it was like God was trying to tell us stuff, I've always been
influenced by bands like The Jesus and Mary Chain and the Cure and
I wanted to be in a band like that but once we got it together a new style
of Music was formed, i suppose is somewhere in the middle of bands like
The velvet underground, The Stone Roses and Spiritualized, it just came 
to us."
 <P>
	Probably the strangest member of this four-piece is the shy and
very quiet Martin Manning, the rhythm guitarist, he never says much and 
he never seems to smile. Lips like Tim burgess and a skinny frame like
Nike Cave gives him away to all the fans wherever he is, especially in
Lincoln where for some reason he has a mass following of young fans.
 <P>
	All in all this band are something special, well worth watching.

	NME - " Leaving Amanda have been touring for what seems like
an eternity and the power they have when they get onto a dark smoky
stage is incredible, they've got to be seen to believed."
