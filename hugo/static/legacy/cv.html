<P>

<UL><LI>I am currently studying for a Ph.D. in the physical chemistry department of Nottingham University. My work involves laser photofragment spectroscopy and mass spectrometry of molecular ions. As part of the project, I have been involved in the design and development of a jet cooled cluster ion source.<P> 
<LI>During my Ph.D. I worked part time as a demonstrator in the second year physical chemistry laboratories and as a supervisor to two third year undergraduate dissertation projects. <P>
<LI>My undergraduate vacation work was a student placement in the Resources Department of Sheffield Hallam University. My main responsibilities were relocation management and building surveying.<P>

<LI>During my Ph.D. I have gained a thorough experience of data management and programming (C, Pascal and Fortran) working on UNIX platforms. I am  the system administrator for a DEC Alpha workstation used for the reduction and analysis or astronomical and lab data. I am also the system administrator for a HP-700 series workstation belonging to the Spectroscopy,Dynamics and Interactions section (5 members of staff and their groups). I have a sound knowledge of internet protocol and use, including setting up my own web site running the apache web server,cgi-scripts. <P>
<LI>I have been contracted to design web pages for the <A HREF="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~pczwww/new">Chemistry Department</A>, writing secure pages, search facilities and writing java scripts. I was employed as a part-time lecturer by Nottingham Trent University to teach undergraduate students HTML<P>
<LI>I have installed hardware and software into/onto personal computers and workstations.<P>
<LI>I have an excellent knowlege various commercial software packages/operating systems Windows 95, Windows 3.11, MS-DOS, MS-Office, Wordperfect for Windows, Lotus 1-2-3, Corel Draw and Microcal Origin.<P>
<LI>I have a broad background in the physical sciences. The transfer from a physics degree to a chemistry-based Ph.D. taught me to adapt quickly to a new academic challenge and to educate myself with minimal supervision.<P>
<LI>I have installed Linux on seven Personal Computers. I have a thorough knowlege of Red-Hat, Slackware and Debian flavours of linux.<P>
<LI>In the third year of my undergraduate studies, I completed the workshop engineering course at Newcastle University.<P>
