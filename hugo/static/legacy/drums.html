She bangs the Drums <P>
With her super-model good looks, she catches  the eye
of all the young men who turn up to Leaving Amanda's live shows. The slow tunes in the bands discography must have all been written
based on this one person. 
 <P>
She drums with a passion like no other, even Phil Collins and Mick Fleetwood
haven't got close to doing things with drums that come so naturally to our
little South Shields sex bomb. Known as `panther' within the band due to her sleek looks and hardwoman of the band attitude, she's one cat that all the boys would like to get their teeth into.
