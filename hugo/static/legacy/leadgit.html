<A HREF="martincorn.html">MARTIN MANNING</A><P>
Age :	22 <P>
Born :<A HREF="http://www.state51.co.uk/knowhere/321.html">Grimsby</A> <P>


	Martin, the rhythm guitarist, was born and brought up in and around Grimsby. <P>
He says his childhood was nothing special, he was just a kid in a mans world.
He needed something more, even from childhood he had a vision. His main aim in
life was to have fun, he didn't care how he got it  or who he trampled on to
get it. <P> <P>
	Martin said " When I was young I used to hassle my mum constantly and when she wasn't giving in
I'd just start crying, it was a good way of winning. I kept that up until I was
about fourteen and then I found out it wasn't cool to cry. I used to get into
loads of fights about it at school and I suppose I was a bit of a loner."
 <P>	It hasn't seemed to affect Martin now though, well not on the surface anyway,
he seems normal enough.
