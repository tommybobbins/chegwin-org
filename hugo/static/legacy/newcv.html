Work Experience
<P>

<H5>
<UL><LI>I am currently studying for a Ph.D. in the physical chemistry department of Nottingham University. My work involves laser photofragment spectroscopy and mass spectrometry of molecular ions. As part of the project, I have been involved in the design and development of a jet cooled cluster ion source. 
<LI>During my Ph.D. I worked part time as a demonstrator in the second year physical chemistry laboratories and as a supervisor to two third year undergraduate dissertation projects. 
<LI>My undergraduate vacation work was a student placement in the Resources Department of Sheffield Hallam University. My main responsibilities were relocation management and building surveying.

Relevant Skills
<H5>
<P>
<UL><LI>My studies rely upon the the day to day maintenance of mass spectrometers.
<LI>I have achieved a good understanding (both theoretically and experimentally) of vacuum techniques.
<LI> I have designed and built ion optics for a new jet cooled cluster ion source for our laboratory.
<LI>During my Ph.D. I have gained a thorough experience of data management and programming (Fortran and Pascal) working on a UNIX platform. I am also the system administrator for a DEC Alpha workstation and have a sound knowledge of internet protocol and use, including setting up my own web site.
<LI>I have a broad background in the physical sciences. The transfer from a physics degree to a chemistry-based Ph.D. taught me to adapt quickly to a new academic challenge and to educate myself with minimal supervision.
<LI>In the third year of my undergraduate studies, I completed the workshop engineering course at Newcastle University.

Leisure Interests
<H5>
<P>
<UL><LI>I am  a keen reader of contemporary British and American fiction.
<LI>I have had an interest in amateur dramatics for many years and I still greatly enjoy visits to the theatre.
<LI>I particularly enjoy music and am an avid record collector/gig goer.
<LI>I enjoy skiing and cycling. I visited the French Alps during the summer of 1996 to see the tour.
<LI>I have had an interest in computing since secondary school and have recently installed LINUX (a UNIX emulator) on two PC's.
