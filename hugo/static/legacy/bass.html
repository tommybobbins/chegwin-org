	Age: 23  <P>


Born:
<A HREF="http://schoolsite.edex.net.uk/175/buxton.htm ">Buxton</A>  <P>




Tommy, the man thats got more charm and sophistication than a pet pit 
bull, is very different to Martin, his cool if slightly disfigured 
features chill any onlookers to the bone. <P>                          
Tommy was born in a small village in Derbyshire, his mother, a 
wealthy teacher, has left a big imprint on Tommys life. Even though 
she brought him up as a young Hippie, he rebelled at an early age and 
turned into a Goth. His image hasn't changed in the last decade; 
kitted out from head to foot in Levis and Doc Martins this man 
catches the eye of most passers by.
His hasn't got too much musical talent but his stage presence and his 
knowledge of music has a big influence on the band.
 <P>
His main Influences are: Spiritualized, Spacemen 3, Oasis, Stereolab and Sonic Boom.
 

 This man has a passion for the underground vibe, a super star in the making.
